What you want is rsync.

This command can be used to synchronize a folder, and also resume copying when it's aborted half way. The command to copy one disk is:

    ## rsync -aAXvxH --delete --exclude={"/dev/*","/proc/*","/sys/*","/tmp/*","/run/*,"/mnt/*","/media/*","/lost+found"} / /path/to/backup/folder ##

The options are:

-a  : all files, with permissions, etc..
-A  : preserve ACLs/permissions (not included with -a)
-X  : preserve extended attributes (not included with -a)
-v  : verbose, mention files
-x  : stay on one file system
-H  : preserve hard links (not included with -a)


To improve the copy speed, add -W (--whole-file), to avoid calculating deltas/diffs of the files. This is the default when both the source and destination are specified as local paths, since the real benefit of rsync's delta-transfer algorithm is reducing network usage.

Also consider adding --numeric-ids to avoid mapping uid/gid values by user/group name.
